Project Description:

I developed a robust Node.js backend project that incorporates comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms, role and permission management, and various e-shop functionalities. The project utilizes modern tools and libraries to ensure security, efficiency, and scalability.

Key Features:

Authentication & Authorization:

JWT-based Authentication: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Password Hashing: Implementation of bcrypt to securely hash user passwords.
Role & Permission Management: Fine-grained access control using roles and permissions.
User Management:

Forgot Password: Secure flow for users to reset their passwords.
Change Password: Functionality allowing users to update their passwords.
Email Notifications: Integration with NodeMailer for sending emails for account-related activities.
E-Shop Features:

Products Management: CRUD operations for managing products.
Categories: Categorization of products for better organization and searchability.
Orders & Order Items: Order processing, including order item management.
File Uploads:

Image Uploads: Implementation using Multer for handling single and multiple image uploads.
Gallery Management: Functionality to manage a gallery of images for products.
The backend is designed to be scalable and secure, providing a solid foundation for any e-commerce application.


write the project description  i was built a nodejs backend project in which implemented Authentication authorization role, permissions and users using jwt, bcrypt hash password, forgot password, changed password , Email creation using Node mailer package, and add e-shop feature Products, category, orders and order items and also upload image and images for gallery using Multer
